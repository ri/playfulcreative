              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>Construction is a vital and massive industry that involves processes with many interconnected parts, all of which need to be executed with precision. However, management is supported by mountains of spreadsheets and rigid software that is decades behind what is possible.</p>
              <p>My client Ennova, is trying to breath new life into this archaic industry by utilising new technology and agile methods to create software that is lean and efficient. Their application, Envision is supported by a young and talented engineering team, but what they lacked was someone who could understand the needs of the users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='envision2'>
              <h4>The Process</h4>
              <p>Working closely with stakeholders, I had a crash course introduction into the construction project life cycle. With this information, I mapped out the key roles that would interact with the app and researched their responsibilities and technical proficiency.</p>
              <p>I then identified and prioritised the goals that they wanted to accomplish with the system and mapped out the specific tasks that fulfilled the goals.</p>
              <p>From there I worked with engineers to figure out the features required for the initial release.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='envision3'>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>For each role, I developed a set of wireframes for each task flow and revised them according to feedback from the stakeholders and engineering team.</p>
              <p>It was challenging to keep switching into the mindsets of different types of people and trying to get a feel of what would be most intuitive for them, as well as making sure what I was designing would help rather than hinder their work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='envision4'>
              <h4>The Application</h4>
              <p>For such a complicated industry, even the simplest minimal viable product is still a massive undertaking and development is still in progress.</p>
              <p></p>

              <h4>The Brief</h4>
              <p>The 2009 <strong>This Way Up</strong> exhibition was a chance to showcase the culmination of knowledge acquired through 4 years of design education. Open to the public, this was the opportunity to impress friends, peers, industry figures and potential employers.</p>
              <p>The challenge for me was to create an interactive piece that was both creative and novel, while experimenting with bridging the gap between art and technology.</p>

              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Working with a partner, we decided to create a physical object that would invite people to directly interact with emotions on the web. Thus, Pixemo was born.</p>
              <p>This installation would tap into data from Twitter and display each message as an expressive pixel figure to invoke a sense of curiousity and play.</p>

              <h4>The Construction</h4>
              <p>The box container for the installation was constructed from wood that was then painted and decorated. The projector was then placed inside and propped in a way to project at the transparent piece of acrylic. Multiple mirrors had to be used to reflect the projection so it would be the right size due the box size constraints. The box also contained a video camera that would stream to a laptop and allow motion detection.</p>

            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='pixemo4'>
              <h4>The Development Process</h4>
              <p>Fueling the backend code was Processing and Java. The connection with twitter was handled by a Java library. It was a challenging but enlightening experience battling with flocking algorithms and edge detection.</p>

                Opening night took place on 11 November and Pixemo was unveiled to the public for the first time.

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>With the rise of digital technologies and online marketplaces, traditional media providers such as book publishers are struggling to adapt to the new environment. University of Queensland Press decided to take matters into their own hands by finding someone with a fresh perspective to research and come up with new ways to distribute, create and promote their books.</p>

            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='uqp2'>
              <h4>Geek in Residence</h4>
              <p>
                The government official body for the Arts in Australia, the Arts Council had just launched a initiative called
                <a href='http://artsdigitalera.com/gir'>Geek in Residence</a>
                that pairs traditional arts organisations with people from digital/technical backgrounds in order to tackle the new problems they were facing.
              </p>
              <p>I signed up for the program and remotely interviewed with UQP in a hostel while  backpacking around Europe. Although book publishing was far from what I'd expected, my curiosity and love for books made me jump on board. I started work shortly after returning from my trip.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='uqp3'>
              <h4>Digital Publishing Research</h4>
              <p>During my time at UQP, I became immersed in the publishing world. I learnt about the traditional process of getting a book out to print, while researching the new technologies that were growing. This included looking into the ebook conversion process, experimental publishing projects and mobile applications.</p>
              <p>One of the projects I worked on was for an iPad app for UQP's children's book collection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='uqp4'>
              <h4>Brand Design</h4>
              <p>I also got the opportunity to use my visual design skills for their marketing work. I  came up with new branding materials and helped facilitate their social media initiative.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='uqp5'>
              <h4>Book Cover Design</h4>
              <p>During my residency, I got to play around with designing covers for UQP's existing books as an exercise. I was then lucky enough to be given the opportunity to design the cover for book that was to be published.</p>
              <p>It was an interesting experience using my design skills in a medium I had not designed for before. I learnt that book covers designers will use one of two distinct styles: literary and commercial, depending on the target market. In the case of <strong>The China Garden</strong>, the brief called for a commercial approach.</p>

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>Having graduated, I had a space of 3 months before I embarked on travel adventures in Europe. I no longer had the constraints of assignments to keep my design skills up and I knew I had to get better at using various design tools in order to become a professional designer.</p>
              <p>
                I then remembered reading about the
                <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)'>10 000 hours</a>
                principle, and I realised that the path to improving was simply to practice.

            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='designaday2'>
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>
                As a subscriber of Smashing Magazine, I stumbled across
                <a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/22/design-something-every-day/'>an article</a>
                which posed a challenge for designers to design something every day. This seemed the perfect solution to getting my skills on track.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some variations of daily design restrict the designs to a theme like Jessica Hiche's
                <a href='www.dailydropcap.com/'>Daily Drop Cap.</a>
                I decided to not impose such restrictions and use the time to explore colour, typography, vectors, 3D modeling and data visualization.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='nivo-html-caption' id='designaday3'>
              <h4>The Results</h4>
              <p>I successfully completed the challenge for 79 days before I flew out to London. In that time I got to play around with Photoshop, Illustrator and Cinema 3D.</p>
              <p>If I had not taken the time to experiment with the design tools, I would not be able to get designs up from my head onto the screen as efficiently as I do now.</p>
              <p>
                You can see all the designs I did in that time
                <a href='http://designaday.marshmalloo.com/'>here.</a>
                Not all are masterpieces, but I met the brief, which was just to deliver something.
