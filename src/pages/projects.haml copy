      #envision1{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Problem
        %p Construction is a vital and massive industry that involves processes with many interconnected parts, all of which need to be executed with precision. However, management is supported by mountains of spreadsheets and rigid software that is decades behind what is possible. 
        %p My client Ennova, is trying to breath new life into this archaic industry by utilising new technology and agile methods to create software that is lean and efficient. Their application, Envision is supported by a young and talented engineering team, but what they lacked was someone who could understand the needs of the users.
      #envision2{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Process
        %p Working closely with stakeholders, I had a crash course introduction into the construction project life cycle. With this information, I mapped out the key roles that would interact with the app and researched their responsibilities and technical proficiency.

        %p I then identified and prioritised the goals that they wanted to accomplish with the system and mapped out the specific tasks that fulfilled the goals.

        %p From there I worked with engineers to figure out the features required for the initial release.
      #envision3{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Solution
        %p For each role, I developed a set of wireframes for each task flow and revised them according to feedback from the stakeholders and engineering team.

        %p It was challenging to keep switching into the mindsets of different types of people and trying to get a feel of what would be most intuitive for them, as well as making sure what I was designing would help rather than hinder their work.
        
      #envision4{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Application
        %p For such a complicated industry, even the simplest minimal viable product is still a massive undertaking and development is still in progress. 
        %p 
        Keep an eye on this space for more images of the finished product.

      #codemountain1{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Problem
        %p Learning to code is not easy. Everyone wants to make an app these days, but in order to create the next big startup, you either need to hire a code genius (there are slim pickings these days) or learn programming yourself.
        %p Even when you get the confidence and decide to take the leap and learn, the sheer amount of concepts and skills you need to acquire to become a proficient programmer seems insurmountable. Plus it's hard to know where to even start with so much learning material out there.
                
      #codemountain2{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Startup Weekend
        %p 
          I was invited by the team behind 
          %a{:href => "http://codeacademy.org"}
            Code Academy
          to join a team to compete in the 
          %a{:href => "http://sparkchi.com"} SPARK Chicago Startup Weekend event. 
          They had felt the hardship of learning how to code themselves and wanted to make an online application that would solve this once and for all. 
        %p The idea got through the initial rounds of pitching and voting and our team worked hard on creating a prototype non-stop through the weekend.
        
      #codemountain3{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Problem Research
        %p What we identified were the main pain points that had been experienced by the team and people around them was not knowing <strong>where to start</strong>, <strong>how to track progress</strong> and <strong>where to get support</strong>.
        %p I then sketched out UI solutions for each of these pain points and produced wireframes for the visual and development team.
                 
      #codemountain4{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Solution
        %p In order to tackle the problem of not knowing where to start, the app would take you through a curated learning path composed of high quality online tutorials. At any point in the course, an 'I'm Stuck' button is available in order to get call for assistance from your friends or others on the mountain. As you progress through each exercise, you can easily track your progress by checking your position on the 'Code Mountain' diagram. You also receive continuous feedback as you increase your understanding of specific concepts and skills. 
          
      #codemountain5{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Win
        %p 
          With help from a polished demo and a brilliant presentation by Neal Sales Griffin, our team scored the win at SPARK startup weekend, winning $10k and over $100k in prizes.
        %p
          In the end, the Code Academy guys decided to keep the focus on their own startup, but I am grateful for having experienced this inspiring and exhilarating event. Read up more about our team

      #pixemo1{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Brief
        %p The 2009 <strong>This Way Up</strong> exhibition was a chance to showcase the culmination of knowledge acquired through 4 years of design education. Open to the public, this was the opportunity to impress friends, peers, industry figures and potential employers. 
        %p The challenge for me was to create an interactive piece that was both creative and novel, while experimenting with bridging the gap between art and technology.

        %h4 The Solution
        %p Working with a partner, we decided to create a physical object that would invite people to directly interact with emotions on the web. Thus, Pixemo was born.
        %p This installation would tap into data from Twitter and display each message as an expressive pixel figure to invoke a sense of curiousity and play.

      #pixemo3{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Construction
        %p The box container for the installation was constructed from wood that was then painted and decorated. The projector was then placed inside and propped in a way to project at the transparent piece of acrylic. Multiple mirrors had to be used to reflect the projection so it would be the right size due the box size constraints. The box also contained a video camera that would stream to a laptop and allow motion detection.
        
      #pixemo4{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Development Process
        %p Fueling the backend code was Processing and Java. The connection with twitter was handled by a Java library. It was a challenging but enlightening experience battling with flocking algorithms and edge detection.

      #uqp1{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Problem
        %p With the rise of digital technologies and online marketplaces, traditional media providers such as book publishers are struggling to adapt to the new environment. University of Queensland Press decided to take matters into their own hands by finding someone with a fresh perspective to research and come up with new ways to distribute, create and promote their books.
        
      #uqp2{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Geek in Residence
        %p 
          The government official body for the Arts in Australia, the Arts Council had just launched a initiative called
          %a{:href=>"http://artsdigitalera.com/gir"} Geek in Residence
          that pairs traditional arts organisations with people from digital/technical backgrounds in order to tackle the new problems they were facing.
        %p I signed up for the program and remotely interviewed with UQP in a hostel while  backpacking around Europe. Although book publishing was far from what I'd expected, my curiosity and love for books made me jump on board. I started work shortly after returning from my trip.
        
      #uqp3{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Digital Publishing Research
        %p During my time at UQP, I became immersed in the publishing world. I learnt about the traditional process of getting a book out to print, while researching the new technologies that were growing. This included looking into the ebook conversion process, experimental publishing projects and mobile applications.
        %p One of the projects I worked on was for an iPad app for UQP's children's book collection. 
        
      #uqp4{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Brand Design
        %p I also got the opportunity to use my visual design skills for their marketing work. I  came up with new branding materials and helped facilitate their social media initiative.
        
      #uqp5{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 Book Cover Design
        %p During my residency, I got to play around with designing covers for UQP's existing books as an exercise. I was then lucky enough to be given the opportunity to design the cover for book that was to be published.
        %p It was an interesting experience using my design skills in a medium I had not designed for before. I learnt that book covers designers will use one of two distinct styles: literary and commercial, depending on the target market. In the case of <strong>The China Garden</strong>, the brief called for a commercial approach.

      #designaday1{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Problem
        %p Having graduated, I had a space of 3 months before I embarked on travel adventures in Europe. I no longer had the constraints of assignments to keep my design skills up and I knew I had to get better at using various design tools in order to become a professional designer. 
        %p 
          I then remembered reading about the 
          %a{:href => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"} 10 000 hours 
          principle, and I realised that the path to improving was simply to practice.
      #designaday2{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Solution
        %p 
          As a subscriber of Smashing Magazine, I stumbled across 
          %a{:href => "http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/22/design-something-every-day/"} an article 
          which posed a challenge for designers to design something every day. This seemed the perfect solution to getting my skills on track.

        %p 
          Some variations of daily design restrict the designs to a theme like Jessica Hiche's 
          %a{:href => "www.dailydropcap.com/"} Daily Drop Cap. 
          I decided to not impose such restrictions and use the time to explore colour, typography, vectors, 3D modeling and data visualization.
  
      #designaday3{:class => "nivo-html-caption"}
        %h4 The Results
        %p I successfully completed the challenge for 79 days before I flew out to London. In that time I got to play around with Photoshop, Illustrator and Cinema 3D.

        %p If I had not taken the time to experiment with the design tools, I would not be able to get designs up from my head onto the screen as efficiently as I do now.
  
        %p 
          You can see all the designs I did in that time

          Not all are masterpieces, but I met the brief, which was just to deliver something.
